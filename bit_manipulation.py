# 5.8 Draw Line: A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive
# pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is , no byte will
# be spl it across rows) . The height of the screen, ofcourse, can be derived from the length of the array
# and the width . Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (xl, y) to (x2, y).
# The method signature should look something like :
# drawL i ne(byte[] screen, int width, int Xl , int x2 , int y)
